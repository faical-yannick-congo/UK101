- regular save file functionality
- sort out processor status display
- find tkii and encoder manuals and scan them
- adaptive number of instructions per loop
- use a SPI ram chip (e.g., 23k256) to boost user memory to 40k
  (this should be quite easy, given the current memory model)
- get superinvaders working (possible cpu emulation bug)
- No SD card being reported sometimes (when there is one)
